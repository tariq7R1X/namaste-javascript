## 📌 What Is a Closure?

A **closure** in JavaScript is a function bundled together with its lexical (outer) environment,  
meaning it retains access to variables even after the outer function has finished execution.

In simpler terms: a function plus the variables it has access to at the time of creation.

---

## 🧠 Core Examples

### 🔹 Basic Closure Example

```js
function x() {
  var a = 7;
  function y() {
    console.log(a);
  }
  return y;
}
const z = x();
z(); // logs 7
```

**Explanation**: Even though `x()` has returned, `y()` still has access to `a` because it forms a closure with its lexical environment.

---

### 🔹 Nested Functions

```js
function z() {
  var b = 900;
  function x() {
    var a = 7;
    function y() {
      console.log(a, b);
    }
    y();
  }
  x();
}
z(); // logs: 7 900
```

**Demonstration**: Accessing both inner and outer variables via closures.

## ⚙️ How Closures Work

JavaScript uses **lexical scope**.  
A function first looks for variables in its own local scope, then in the outer scopes (its lexical environment).

When a function like `y` is returned, the closure (function + its captured scope) travels with it,  
allowing it to access variables even outside of their original runtime context.

---

## ✅ Use Cases & Advantages

Closures enable powerful patterns such as:

- **Module Design Pattern**: Encapsulate private data and expose only what's necessary
- **Currying**: Partially apply functions while preserving internal state
- **Memoization**: Cache expensive computation results within the closure
- **Data Hiding / Encapsulation**: Protect certain variables from being externally accessed or modified
- **Event Handling**: Maintain access to state in `setTimeout`, event listeners, etc.

---

## 🛑 Risks & Disadvantages

- **Memory Consumption**: Closures retain variables, even if not used
- **Potential Memory Leaks**: Large scopes enclosed unnecessarily
- **Performance Impact**: Overuse in large-scale apps can affect browser performance

## 🧪 Closures in Practice

### 🔹 Returning a Function to Maintain State

```js
function getFullName(firstName) {
  return function(lastName) {
    console.log(firstName, lastName);
  };
}
const printJohnName = getFullName('John');
printJohnName('Smith'); // John Smith
```

Each returned function remembers its own `firstName` via closure—even after the outer function has completed execution.

---

### 🔹 Closures with DOM Events

```js
const colorChanger = (color) => () => {
  document.getElementById('paragraph').style.color = color;
};
const green = colorChanger('green');
const blue = colorChanger('blue');
btnGreen.onclick = green;
btnBlue.onclick = blue;
```

Each event handler retains access to its respective `color` variable via closure.

## 🧾 Summary Table

| Concept         | Explanation                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Closure         | Function + lexical environment that persists |
| Lexical Scope   | Scope based on function’s code location  |
| Use Cases       | Modules, currying, memoization, hiding state |
| Drawbacks       | Memory leaks, consumption, performance hit |

## 🎯 Why This Topic Matters

Closures are a **fundamental yet often misunderstood concept**.  
Even experienced developers struggle with them, yet they’re frequently asked in frontend interviews.

Episode 10 of Namaste JavaScript simplifies the topic with strong visual + code-based explanation,  
helping you confidently apply closures in real-world JavaScript and interviews.

## ✅ TL;DR (Quick Recap)

- A **closure** enables a function to access variables from its parent environment even after the parent has exited.
- Useful for modular code, currying, and memoization.
- Must be handled carefully to avoid memory issues.
- **Mastering closures makes your JavaScript cleaner and interview-ready.**
